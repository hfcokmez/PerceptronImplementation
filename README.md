# Implementation of Perceptron Algorithm

## Dataset
perceptronDataset.mat includes classes and class labels. There are two classes where each
class consists of 2-dimensional 100 feature vectors and two class labels as 1 (class 1), 2 (class 2).

## Implementation
Initial weights for the linear discriminant function are has been set to  [1, 1, -0.5]T and [1, 1, 0.5]T.
In each case final weight vectors and two classes are plotted.

## Results
